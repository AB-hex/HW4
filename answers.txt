1) 3 hours
2) We understand that we can scan many pages quickly and effectively for our goal by using a script.
We can use this it for counting how many times a product is mentioned in articles and when we see that the counter is higher significantly we can understand that this product has a new version.
3) We can run it automatically every hour by using the "repeat" command. In addition we need internet connection and a server. For ensuring we don't read again the same articles we should save the list of the addresses of the articles and when we use again the script we grep every article's address in the list and will search our key word only in the addresses that don't appear in the list.
